# Salesforce DX Project - LWC-ChartJS:

The purpose of this lwc project was to show lwc component using Chart.js and practice how to use it.
Chart.js is a chart library that is available as a client-side JavaScript package.

## Any standard components?

There are two lwc components from Repo trailheadapps/lwc-recipes
1. errorPanel
2. viewSource

Please refer the link: https://github.com/trailheadapps/lwc-recipes

## Any 3rd party components?

I quoted the lwc components "gen_barchart" and "gen_opportunitychart" from another github repo for learning purpose.
I modified a little while studying the lwc lifecycle.
